# Birthday Surprise Website 🎂🎉

This is a special **Birthday Celebration Website** created using **Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion**, and **Lucide Icons**.  
It's designed as a personal and emotional way to wish someone special — when you can't be there physically, let your code speak! 💖

## 🧠 Project Idea

> **POV:** It's her birthday, but you can't meet — so you build something special instead.

The website features:

- A live countdown timer ⏳
- Personalized birthday messages 🎈
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion ✨
- Cute icons and a heartfelt design 💌

This was created as part of an emotional reel where the journey begins with a few lines of code in VS Code and ends with a beautiful surprise on the browser.
